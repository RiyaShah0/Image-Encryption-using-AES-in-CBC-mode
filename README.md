# Image-Encryption-using-AES-in-CBC-mode

## Overview
This project implements a **secure and efficient image encryption system** using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm in **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** mode. It is designed to enhance the privacy of digital image data by converting pixel information into encrypted ciphertext while preserving image structure and performance.

## Features
- 🔐 **AES Encryption in CBC Mode**  
  Secure image encryption based on the widely-used AES algorithm operating in CBC mode to ensure strong confidentiality.

- 🖼️ **Image Preprocessing & Optimization**  
  Images are preprocessed and resized before encryption to ensure consistent performance and compatibility across various formats.

- ⚡ **Fast & Reliable Performance**  
  Achieved an **average encryption time of 0.009 seconds** with a **low standard deviation of 0.002 seconds** across 100 trials, demonstrating efficiency and stability.

- 📄 **Published Research**  
  Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper:
  > **"Enhanced image encryption using AES algorithm with CBC mode: A secure and efficient approach"**  
  Published in: *Iran Journal of Computer Science* (2024), Pages 1–17.
